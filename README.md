--- Used to classify image --- 

Python libraries to install:
1. pip install numpy
2. pip install keras
3. pip install tensorflow

 -> We use binary classification in which output is either 0 or 1.
 -> We follow supervised learning where we define set of inputs and outputs classes and train them to recognise using photos.

-> First create images dataset of any two objects(for eg here we taken orange and watermelon)
-> Then training takes place using deep learning techniques, finally testing happens.
